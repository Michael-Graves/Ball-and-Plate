# Ball-and-Plate
This project's goal was the design and implementation of a 2 degree of freedom ball and plate system. This system's goal is to use real-time control systems and embedded microcontrollers to balance a ball on a flat plate. The project was proposed and implemented as part of the SFU class: Real-Time and Embedded Control Systems - MSE 450.  The project used PID feedback controllers to control the pitch and roll of the platform to provide control of the ball's position. A resistive touch screen was used for position feedback and two low-cost hobby servos were used for platform actuation. The controller was implemented in C on a Texas Instruments Tiva C microcontroller (EK-TM4C123GXL). The mechanical structure was designed using SolidWorks and 3D printed on an inexpensive Prusa i3 clone.
